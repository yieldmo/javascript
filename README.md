## Engineering Vision
  
  **We strive for collaboration, architecture and quality in the products we build:**

  - In collaboration we value shared understanding, review process throughout and a culture of challenging ideas
  - Architecturally we strive for flexible, componentized and modularity.
  - In quality we value well tested and documented and clearly articulated code.

## Review Principles
  
  - **It's about the team**: When giving criticism, nothing is the committer’s fault. If there is a problem in a commit, it’s everyone’s problem in our codebase, and it’s everyone’s responsibility to rectify. 

  - **Focus on the substance**: It could be easy to get caught up with formatting and semantics. However we should try to leave that to automation as much as possible. The focus should be having a solid understanding of the logic to a point that it feels comfortable to contribute to the same piece of code.

  - **Make it a learning opportunity**: We all have something to learn from each other. Draw value from reading other people's code and collaborating with each other.

## Review Etiquette
  
  - **Criticism**: Code review shouldn't be an opportunity to show technical superiority over other people; it's about iterating on solutions and making each other better.
  
  - **Compliments**: Code review shouldn't be just about finding errors or giving constructive feedback, it's also a great place to promote good engineering. So do not shy away from giving your teammate a shout-out when you see brilliant thinking.

## Review Flow

  - Each review should be an open and ongoing conversation:
    - The PR is a live conversation happening among developers.
    - For new features or formats, mark it as "WIP" in Gitlab. Such a PR may last over the course of a sprint (or sprints) and have various check points in the converstion.
    - For a bug fix or quick tweak, create a pull request the normal way. Such a PR shouldn't contain too many changed lines.
  - Continuously push commits to remote:
    - Ask for feedback every a few commits proactively, or create a sub-PR if necessary, instead of lumping them together in a single review.
    - The author should specify: 
      - What to be looked at specifically
      - By what time should be code be reviewed
  - When in doubt, feel free to pair program or schedule quick review sessions.
  - Every commit should be accompanied by a message that describes the code change well.
  - For major features, merge production code to the feature branch often to ensure backwards compatibility.
  - Every PR should have a main assignee, who would sign off on the PR and notify the author to merge the code in.
  - All "non-LGTM" comments are considered show-stoppers and must be addressed before merging.
  - All code should be well-tested and well-documented during the review process.

## Branching Strategy

  - Formats or major features: `feature/...`, branch off from `dev`
    - You can start sub branches off from the main feature branch: `feature/.../...`
    - Merge sub feature branches to the main `feature/...` branch
    - Eventually merge the main feature branch back to `dev`
  - Prod fixes: `hotfix/...`, branch off from `master` directly
  - Bug fixes: `bugfix/...`, branch off from `dev`
  - A/B tests: `abtest/...`, should NOT be merged to `dev` or `master`

## Commit Messages

  - Good commit messages matter. They make `git log` a very powerful tool to get a full picture of what has changed
  - Capitalize the subject line and limit it to 50 characters. Do not end the subject line with a period
  - For small changes, it's ok to leave the body empty; if the subject exceeds 50 characters, then consider adding a body
  - When a commit merits a bit of explanation and context, it's necessary to write a body
    - Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
    - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
    - You can leave out details about how a change has been made, which is what comments in code is about
  - Use the imperative mood in the subject line. A commit subject should always be able to complete the following sentence:
    - If applied, this commit will your *subject line* here
    - For example: *If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation*
